                    <h2>My Tech Goals for the Next 2 Years</h2>
                    <p>
                        As I approach the completion of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, my primary goal for the coming year is to graduate successfully. 
                        This milestone will mark the beginning of an exciting journey toward advanced education and professional growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon graduating, I plan to pursue a Master of Science (MSc) in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
                        I am passionate about the immense potential these fields hold for transforming industries and solving complex problems.
                          My goal is to gain a deep understanding of machine learning algorithms, data analysis techniques, and AI-driven solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In parallel with my academic pursuits, I aim to enhance my skills as a frontend developer.
                         I will continue to refine my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also exploring advanced frameworks
                          and libraries such as React and Next js.
                          My objective is to create fully functional, responsive, and visually appealing user interfaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I am excited about the prospect of integrating my software development skills with AI technologies.
                        I plan to work on projects that leverage the synergy between these domains, 
                        such as developing intelligent web applications, predictive analytics tools, 
                        and automated solutions that address real-world challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, my tech goals for the next two years are focused on academic excellence, skill enhancement, and innovative project development. I am committed to continuous learning and growth, and I look forward to making significant contributions to the tech industry.
                    </p>
